# Farmer's Support Forum

The repository contains and additional file for k-means clustering.
We plan to use this Unsupervised Machine Learning method to provide farmers with latest articles and news on the agriculture, weather, etc in that farmer's locality based on the input entered.

The ppt also contains the code and explaination for an API integration that can be implemented in the marketplace to show real-time updates in market values of farmers commodities as well as keep the rates for said commodities fair for both, the farmers and the sellers. The API we have used is Agmarket which is run and maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare under the Government of India. 

We hope this project successfully helps ensure sustainable agricultural practices for food security
